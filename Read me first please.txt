Out of the four instruction of the screening test, I manage to finish 1 to 3,
but when applying JWT authentication on my Rest API, the project was filled with error.
Such error is when applying [from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views] in urls.py
it cause red underline on both rest_framework_simplejwt and jwt_views which prevent the api to run
therefore, to avoid error, I erased them from my code.

Rest API manage to GET, POST, and PUT either from localhost directly or using Postman(or similar application) 

If both api and vuejs run both at the same time, 
please activate CORS in order for vuejs to obtain data from the rest api.

Thank you for reading!
